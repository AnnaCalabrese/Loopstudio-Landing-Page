# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

![Design preview for the Loopstudios landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to: 

- View the responsive website for mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px)
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links
I deployed this completed challenge on Netlify:
- https://loopstudio-page.netlify.app/

### Built with

- HTML5/CSS3
- SASS
- Vanilla Javascript for the menu
- Mobile-first workflow
- Firefox developer tools

### What I learned
I decided to really challenge myself this time and build everything with SASS, which I've never done before but after practicing CSS for a while I felt comfortable to switch.
I struggled a little with inserting the media queries in SASS and with the toggle menu but one of the most important things that I have learned is the picture element
which really saved me time and is way more efficient than anything else.

### What should I focus on in the future to improve my skills (how can I become a better programmer)?
I need to improve on using all the features that SASS has to offer so that I can be a quicker programmer because I feel a bit slow and I want to try Tailwind as a CSS framework.
